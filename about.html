                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I'm currently earning my MBA/MEng at UC Berkeley,
                            and I've always been passionate about robotics
                            engineering. Before Berkeley, I was at Uber for a
                            year working on self-driving cars. Before that, I
                            was at Sikorsky Aircraft for 4 years working on
                            autonomous aircraft for the DARPA ALIAS program.
                            Prior to that, I graduated from Worcester
                            Polytechnic Institute in 2015 with two Bachelor's
                            degrees in Robotics and Mechanical Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I practice web design, electronics,
                            programming, typography, and woodworking. I've
                            always held a strong belief in the importance of
                            balancing engineering sciences with vibrant arts, so
                            I've constantly drawn to both. I'm especially
                            attracted to environments where I am continually
                            learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also enjoy giving back to the community through
                            volunteer work; I've volunteered with FIRST
                            Robotics, performed magic shows, worked exhibits at
                            the Museum of Science in Boston, and done graphic
                            design work for <a
                            href="http://www.essenceofindia.org/">Essence of
                            India</a>, an annual celebration of classical Indian
                            culture and heritage in my hometown.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My interests are ever-expanding&mdash;I enjoy
                            reading, traveling, building, photographing,
                            driving, building sound systems, playing table
                            tennis, and having chill sessions with friends. I'm
                            also a fan of usability and front-end design.

                        <p>
                            I designed this website on my own and coded it
                            on top of
                            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter's
                            Bootstrap</a> templates and the <a
                            href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> framework.
                            It was my first foray into HTML and CSS, and it's
                            been a lot of fun. Thanks to the powers of
                            Bootstrap, this website is fully optimized for your
                            mobile display, as well. Enjoy!
                        </p>
