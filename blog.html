                            They call it the curse of knowledge: when you've
                            known something for so long that you can't remember
                            ever not knowing it. You suddenly find you've become
                            a bad teacher, impatient because you can't
                            understand how someone else could have so much
                            trouble with something you've seemingly always
                            known.

                            I got started in software later than many of my
                            friends, so I can appreciate just how difficult the
                            learning curve can be. I hope to use this blog to
                            ease some of the hardest parts in the hopes of
                            helping someone else making the same journey. And to
                            teach myself just how much more I have to learn.
