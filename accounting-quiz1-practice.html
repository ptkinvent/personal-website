On November 1st the company receives $9,000 advances from customers for coffee to be delivered on February 1st the following year. Indicate whether the debt-to-equity ratio increases, decreases or stays the same. Assume a ratio of 1 before this transaction.', {

        Remember: The Debt-to-equity ratio is equal to total debt divided by total equity. When a dividend is paid out, it will reduce equity, which is the denominator in this equation.

Generally speaking, mentioning that the market to book being less than 1 suggests that the company might be undervalued. Also, in order to decide whether you should buy or sell the stock, you should compare your own expectation of $12 million to both what analysts are expecting and to management guidance. If your expectation exceeds that of analysts and the company then it might be a good investment since the market usually reflects the expectations of the company and the analysts who cover the company.'),
