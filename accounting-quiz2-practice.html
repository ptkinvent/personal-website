However, since Fedurch is too busy working on his growing business, please help him answer the questions below.'),

The lease is for one year ending on 7/30/2021 and the payment amount was $240,000 ($20,000 per month).  What is the effect on the net income of “Dumble Doors, LLC” for the year ending 12/31/2020? (Include a negative sign, if applicable)', function(ans) { return (-100000 - 1000 <= ans && ans <= -100000 + 1000) || ans == -100; }, true, 'Correct answers: -$100,000 (with margin $1,000) or -$100 (with margin $0).'),
        new NumericalQuestion('Q2. Fedurch took out a one-year loan for $100,000 on 11/1/20. The loan carries a 12% interest rate and both the interest and principal are payable after one year.

        new NumericalQuestion('Q3. Fedurch received $40,000 in cash from a customer on 7/1/20 for doors that were not provided at that time. Fedurch provided 40% of the doors to this customer on 12/31/20. The gross profit margin [(revenue-cost of revenue)/revenue] for each door sold is 25%.

        new NumericalQuestion('Q4. On 10/1/2020, Fedurch sold a door-manufacturing machine for $12,000. He originally purchased the machine for $60,000. At the time of sale the machine had $45,000 in accumulated depreciation.

        new ExplanationQuestion('Q6. As Fedurch is both paying for his MBA tuition and funding his business, he is trying to minimize his expenses by eating out at “Starve”-bucks Coffee, Inc.  While waiting in the long line to order his favorite tap water with ice, he decided to analyze the statement of cash flows of the company.  After hearing from Professor Even-Tov that you are experts on the statement of cash flows, Fedurch wants your help analyzing what happened to each of the two accounts mentioned in the questions below during the year 2020. Below is the statement of cash flows of “Starve”-bucks Coffee, Inc. <img class="my-3" width=100%% src="img/accounting-quiz2-starvebucks.png"> <strong>See Example for how to answer the effect on Accounts Receivable:</strong> <br> A change in accounts receivables can take place in one of the following: a) the company sold on account and b) a customer paid for a prior purchase that was sold on account.  The change in 2020 in the Statement of Cash Flows indicates that there was an increase in accounts receivables that was due to sales on account.  This means that the net income number was $X.X higher than the actual cash in the bank, so the net income must be adjusted downwards to meet cash.'),
        new TextQuestion('Q6a. Based on the StarveBucks financial statement shown above, please write a response similar to the above for Accounts Payable.', 'Accounts payable reflect purchases to suppliers that have been recognized on the income statement, but have not been paid for yet.  As a result, the net income number will be higher than the real cash number, so net income is adjusted downwards to match the cash balance (lower accounts payable in 2020 in comparison to 2019 by $210.8).'),
        new TextQuestion('Q6b. What would have been the effect on “Starve”-bucks Coffee, Inc\'s net cash provided from operating activities if it had to record an additional $30,000 in depreciation expense? Please provide a detailed explanation (assume no taxes are paid)', 'There is no effect to net cash by operating activities because depreciation is a non-cash expense.  Net Income is lower by $30,000 but depreciation is added back in the cash flow statement, so the net effect will be 0.'),
        new TextQuestion('Q6c. Using the Statement of Cash Flows of “Starve”-bucks Coffee, Inc. please indicate whether “Starve”-bucks Coffee, Inc is in a stage of early stage, growth, maturity, or decline and provide an explanation to support your choice using some of the concepts discussed in lecture. Please refer to the Statement of Cash Flows above.', 'The company’s stage is somewhere between growth and maturity, but more leaning towards maturity.  The company generates a lot of cash from its operations, which it uses to invest in PP&E (a sign of growth) and purchase investments (a sign of maturity).  The company’s financing is not a source of cash – in fact it has been increasing repurchase of common stock and dividends paid for the past three years (sign of maturity).  It is not in decline because the company’s CFO increases seems solid over the three years, and there is no reason to suggest the company is in decline.'),
